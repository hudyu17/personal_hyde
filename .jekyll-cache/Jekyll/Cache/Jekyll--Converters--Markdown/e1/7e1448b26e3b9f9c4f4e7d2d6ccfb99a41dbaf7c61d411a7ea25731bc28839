This was the biggest project that I've undertaken in a while. The goal behind this platform was to connect those who were looking for fashion advice (aka don't know how to dress, which may or may not include me) with fashionable people who love giving fashion advice. Simple, right?

It was not simple

The site aggregates live videos of harbours and beaches, thrown in with some Jazz music and a map, because everyone loves maps (and I was trying to use react leaflet in something).
