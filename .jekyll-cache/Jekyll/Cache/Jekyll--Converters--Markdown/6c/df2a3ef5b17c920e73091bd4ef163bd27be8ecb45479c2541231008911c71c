HousingHelper üè† (Capstone Project)
</h1>
<hr />

<p>I‚Äôm in the <a href="https://www.schoolofcities.utoronto.ca/multidisciplinary-urban-capstone-project" target="_blank">Multidisciplinary Urban Capstone Project</a> at UofT, working in a team of 6 students to design a new affordable housing development.</p>

<p>To say this goes beyond the scope of my studies would be an understatement, but this is an opportunity for some product development - because anything is an opportunity for product development üòé</p>

<p>I decided to take the lead on building a tool that <strong>produces design requirements and analyses the financial feasibility of alternatives.</strong> I‚Äôve documented my thinking below:</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Our capstone client is a collective of public and private stakeholders (e.g. the City, engineering design firms) with the mandated goal of creating long-lasting affordable housing in Toronto.</p>

<p>They have 3 operational pillars (which loosely translate into epics):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Does it pencil? (is it feasible)</li>
  <li>Does it scale? (can they have practices that translate to other sites)</li>
  <li>How can we accelerate delivery?</li>
</ol>

<p>Our specific project tasks us with proposing a development on a specific site. We scoped this ask down into 2 deliverables:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Masterplan (the architectural design)</li>
  <li>Business plan</li>
</ol>

<h2>Product Vision</h2>
<p>I‚Äôll admit it - this isn‚Äôt a small task for anyone, let alone 6 undergraduate students. <strong>The motivation behind making HousingHelper is to simply make our lives easier + deliver long-term value to our client.</strong> The following is some loose thinking to come up with the ideal state for the tool.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm focusing on the <em>business plan</em> side of the 2 deliverables. I realised that this tackles <em>Pillar 1 (does it pencil)</em> by:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Guiding the physical design by explaining what is financially feasible i.e. optimise the layout/functions for profitability and social benefit</li>
  <li>Quantifying that feasibility e.g. determining profitability, payback periods</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Pillar 2 (does it scale)</em> could then be achieved by a separate tool that identifies similar sites based on input parameters (e.g. clustering census tracts in Toronto based on construction costs, incomes, rents), but might be something for another day.</p>

<p>For good measure, I threw this into the Crossing the Chasm framework:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>For</strong> Client stakeholders and design teams (including us)</li>
  <li><strong>Who</strong> want to determine key design requirements for potential developments</li>
  <li><strong>HousingHelper is</strong> a calculator/optimiser</li>
  <li><strong>That</strong> produces multiple sets of financially feasible alternatives</li>
</ul>

<h2>Specifications</h2>

<h3>Product summary</h3>

<p>There are several things to optimise and produce sets of:</p>

<p><em>Residential usage</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Setaside percentage (% of housing that is affordable, &gt;30% for us)</li>
  <li>Unit type split</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Non-residential usage</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Commercial usage split (e.g. retail, office)</li>
  <li>Amount of commercial (residential is generally fixed e.g. at least x units)</li>
  <li>Number of parking spots</li>
</ul>

<p>Parameters that are relevant for optimisation:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Construction</th>
    <th>Permanent</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Revenues (variable)</th>
    <td>Investors, city funding, developer equity, loans</td>
    <td>Rental units, commercial rental</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Costs</th>
    <td>Hard costs (fixed), soft costs (fixed), land (nominal), subsidies (variable)</td>
    <td>Loan repayments, operating costs e.g. maintenance and taxes (all variable)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Business case for HousingHelper</h3>
<p>Our client retains accountants that can produce industry-standard pro formas and cash flow statements, so that‚Äôs not our job.</p>

<p>What we can do instead is provide preliminary estimates of the variables outlined in the Optimise section, producing ballpark requirements that can serve as guidelines for further investigation.</p>

<p>Creating a dynamic tool allows this process to be repeated efficiently with new parameters and across different sites in the future, bringing lasting value to the client and speeding up their workflow.</p>

<p>In the immediate term, HousingHelper helps our design team evaluate more options and get things done quicker.</p>

<h3>User stories</h3>
<p>These aren‚Äôt based solely on client-side stakeholders, but also our own team members (since this is an internal tool that will be used by design teams in the future)</p>

<p><strong>As an</strong> architectural practice</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>We want to</strong> know the firm requirements of the development e.g. number of retail floors</li>
  <li><strong>So that we can</strong> actually design the thing</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>As a</strong> planning organisation</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>We want to</strong> evaluate the financial feasibility of the development e.g. breakeven duration</li>
  <li><strong>So that we can</strong> obtain funding, start necessary conversations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>As a</strong> community organisation</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>We want to</strong> know what types of housing and non-residential uses will be available</li>
  <li><strong>So that we can</strong> make arrangements to relocate people or complement non-residential uses</li>
</ul>

<h2>Roadmapping and prioritisation</h2>

<h3>Epic 1: does it pencil</h3>
<p>I‚Äôll undertake the development process in 3 stages, largely corresponding to these 3 stories. This roadmapping also isn‚Äôt spec‚Äôd out to the max, because I still need to work out the nitty gritty of the calculation process üò¨</p>

<p><strong>Story 1: physical details</strong></p>

<p>Output several scenarios with different</p>
<ul>
  <li>Residential floors</li>
  <li>Commercial space</li>
  <li>Parking spots</li>
</ul>

<p>Potential inputs</p>
<ul>
  <li>Expected occupancy rates for unit types</li>
  <li>Size restrictions (height, max num units, floor plate area)</li>
  <li>Demographics (income, diversity)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Story 2: finances</strong></p>

<p>Calculate the following for each output scenario</p>
<ul>
  <li>Setaway percentage</li>
  <li>Projected revenues</li>
  <li>Projected costs mostly constant
‚Üí Breakeven duration</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Story 3: usage</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Unit types</li>
  <li>Specific non-residential uses</li>
</ul>

<p>With this breakdown, I have a clearer sense of the product:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The functionality of stories 1 and 2 are complementary; changing the parameters/outputs of one will update the other</li>
  <li>The usage of story 3 can be applied to whatever scenario has been selected</li>
</ul>

<h3>Epic 2: does it scale (later on)</h3>

<p>There‚Äôs room here to crack out some stats e.g. clustering areas in Toronto, identifing similar clusters to a user input</p>

<h2>Actual design</h2>
<p>In progress, stay tuned üòà</p>
