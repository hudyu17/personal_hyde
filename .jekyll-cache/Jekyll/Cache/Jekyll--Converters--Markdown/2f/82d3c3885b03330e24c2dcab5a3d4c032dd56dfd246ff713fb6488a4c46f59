betterbox ðŸ“¦, coming soon

<hr />

<p>We havenâ€™t built anything yet, but hereâ€™s the premise.</p>

<p>Subscription boxes are <a href="https://twitter.com/explodingtopics/status/1415332979610570752" target="_blank"> getting more popular</a>, probably because weâ€™ve been at home for over a year.</p>

<p><del>The biggest</del> one problem with these services is the <strong>waste</strong> of throwing out a fairly sturdy cardboard box with <strong>every monthly/quarterly delivery</strong>.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re therefore trying to make a reusable box, one thatâ€™ll hopefully facilitate a truly circular process.</p>
