lookgoodr, an obituary
</h1>
<hr />

<p>This was the biggest project that Iâ€™ve undertaken in a while, and it honestly didnâ€™t turn out that great ğŸ¤¡ Consider this an obituary to the incredibly-named <strong>lookgoodr</strong>:</p>

This platform sought to <strong>connect those who were looking for fashion advice</strong> (aka donâ€™t know how to dress, which may or may not include me) <strong>with stylish people who love giving fashion advice.</strong></p>

<p>The goal behind this was to fuel the <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/" target="_blank"> passion economy</a>.</p>

<p>I wanted to help people better monetise interests and skills that I believe are valuable, but havenâ€™t been traditionally seen as such.</p>

<p>In this case, the value of having fashion sense. People pay for advice all the time - why shouldnâ€™t those with fashion sense be able to profit as well?

<p><strong>Mistake 1: Fundamentally misunderstanding the problem</strong></p>

<p>Turns out that this isnâ€™t that big a problem, or at least the target market was very narrow.</p>

<p>Those who care about dressing better would probably be actively searching for ways to do such, either through friends or the million reddit threads out there on the topic.</p>

<p>Those who donâ€™t care about style - well, they wouldnâ€™t pay money for this anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Mistake 2: Not understanding the buyer</strong></p>

<p>We initially targeted students/fresh grads in tech who wore hoodies during their entire undergrad and now have money to spend on clothes.</p>

<p>This decision was made (mostly by me) despite the fact that nobody from this demographic actually expressed a huge desire to dress better; it was always a: â€œsure, Iâ€™d <em>probably</em> want toâ€ - but who doesnâ€™t?</p>

<p>There were definitely positives coming out of this. First off, it was fun ğŸ˜</p>

<p>I also realised how exciting it is to work with</p>
