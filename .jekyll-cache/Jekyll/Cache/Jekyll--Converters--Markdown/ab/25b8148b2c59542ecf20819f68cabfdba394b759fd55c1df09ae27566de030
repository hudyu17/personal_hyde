lookgoodr, an obituary
</h1>
<hr />

<p>This was the biggest project that Iâ€™ve undertaken in a while. The goal behind this platform was to <strong>connect those who were looking for fashion advice</strong> (aka donâ€™t know how to dress, which may or may not include me) <strong>with stylish people who love giving fashion advice.</strong> Simple, right?</p>

<p>Turns out that this isnâ€™t that big a problem, or at least the target market was very narrow.</p>

<p>Those who care about dressing better would probably be actively searching for ways to do such, either through friends or the million reddit threads out there on the topic. Those who donâ€™t care about style - well, they wouldnâ€™t pay money for this anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Mistake 1:</strong> not understanding the buyer enough. We offered 3 services based on some market research of my target demographic: students/fresh grads in tech who wore hoodies during their entire undergrad and now have money to spend on clothes.</p>
