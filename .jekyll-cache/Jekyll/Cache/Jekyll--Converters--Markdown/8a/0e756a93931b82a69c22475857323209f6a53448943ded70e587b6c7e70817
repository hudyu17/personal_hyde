 We won! <a href="http://www.apotex.ca/" target="_blank">Apotex</a> challenged 20 teams to help improve their understanding of the bid process using artificial intelligence and machine learning. This was my first ever case competition, and I'm grateful to have worked with a wonderful team: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chantelle-shing-87b2a417a/" target="_blank">Chantelle Shing</a>, <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/david-jh-wong" target="_blank">David Wong</a>, and <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/trudiecheung" target="_blank">Trudie Cheung</a>.

 Below is the slide that showed our data science workflow:

We first aggregated a flood of data from multiple excel sheets to create a baseline model, the logic being that any prediction should improve upon this baseline. This created a dataset with hundreds of attributes, encouraging us to perform dimensionality reduction. We ran into some issues with PCA, so we ended up performing feature selection.
<br /><br />
From this, we tried 2 machine learning techniques: random forests and building a multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP). The random forest actually performed slightly better than the MLP, and with the added benefit of interpretability, we decided to go with the former. Finally, we presented our findings in a business context that justified certain strategies and uses of the data. 
<br /><br />
This project tested both our technical and business acumen. Not only were we challenged to apply statistical techniques to real-world situations, we had to frame our findings in an interpretable and useful manner to solve a business challenge. Thanks again to Apotex and UNIC for organising!
