lookgoodr, an obituary
</h1>
<hr />

<p>This was the biggest project that I’ve undertaken in a while, and it honestly didn’t turn out that great 🤡 Consider this an obituary to the incredibly-named lookgoodr:</p>

<p>The goal behind this platform was to <strong>connect those who were looking for fashion advice</strong> (aka don’t know how to dress, which may or may not include me) <strong>with stylish people who love giving fashion advice.</strong> Simple, right?</p>

<p><strong>Mistake 1: Fundamentally misunderstanding the problem</strong>
Turns out that this isn’t that big a problem, or at least the target market was very narrow.</p>

<p>Those who care about dressing better would probably be actively searching for ways to do such, either through friends or the million reddit threads out there on the topic.</p>

<p>Those who don’t care about style - well, they wouldn’t pay money for this anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Mistake 2: Not understanding the buyer</strong> 
We initially targeted students/fresh grads in tech who wore hoodies during their entire undergrad and now have money to spend on clothes.</p>

<p>This decision was made (mostly by me) despite the fact that nobody from this demographic actually expressed a huge desire to dress better; it was always a: “sure, I’d <em>probably</em> want to” - but who doesn’t?</p>

<p>**Mistake 3:</p>
