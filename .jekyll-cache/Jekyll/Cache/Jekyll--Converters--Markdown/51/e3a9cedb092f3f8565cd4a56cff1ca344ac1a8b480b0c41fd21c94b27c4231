<p>Go to any airport in America and youâ€™ll see them. Of the approximately 23,000 commercial aircraft in service worldwide, <strong>nearly 30% are from this single aircraft family</strong>. If youâ€™ve been on the internet in the past 6 months and guessed the first plane that came to mind, congratulations! Itâ€™s <em>that</em> plane.</p>

<p>It should be the 8th wonder of the world that a plane with a fuselage straight out of the 1950s is still around. It should be the 9th wonder that itâ€™s the second most popular aircraft family in service. Thatâ€™s right â€” not in terms of all-time orders, but in terms of aircraft <em>still flying today</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, these 737s arenâ€™t the same as those from 50 years ago, right? Those 737s looked like this:</p>

<p>Look closer. The fuselage, although lengthened and raised, is exactly that â€” lengthened and raised. <strong>Itâ€™s fundamentally the same fuselage used on the Boeing 707 and 727,</strong> fine aircraft that Boeing had the sense to retire when the time was appropriate. The 737 remains, at heart, a 100-seat hopper designed to sit as low to the ground as possible to allow for boarding through built-in airstairs. It wasnâ€™t built to carry 200 passengers across the Atlantic, but thatâ€™s exactly what Boeing did with the MAX.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s like putting a V8 in a Smart Car and then stretching it. You should probably just buy a different car.
If you donâ€™t really care about aviation (first, thanks for reading this because I probably sent you the link), this derivative-mania still affects you. Trading technological advancement for safe profits does more harm than good. This article examines why aircraft design is risky, but also why itâ€™s more dangerous to avoid taking risks.</p>
