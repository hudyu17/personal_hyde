- _Jim McNerney: President and CEO of the Boeing Company (2005–2015)_


Go to any airport in America and you’ll see them. Of the approximately 23,000 commercial aircraft in service worldwide, **nearly 30% are from this single aircraft family**. If you’ve been on the internet in the past 6 months and guessed the first plane that came to mind, congratulations! It’s _that_ plane.

It should be the 8th wonder of the world that a plane with a fuselage straight out of the 1950s is still around. It should be the 9th wonder that it’s the second most popular aircraft family in service. That’s right — not in terms of all-time orders, but in terms of aircraft _still flying today_.

Of course, these 737s aren’t the same as those from 50 years ago, right? Those 737s looked like this:

Look closer. The fuselage, although lengthened and raised, is exactly that — lengthened and raised. **It’s fundamentally the same fuselage used on the Boeing 707 and 727,** fine aircraft that Boeing had the sense to retire when the time was appropriate. The 737 remains, at heart, a 100-seat hopper designed to sit as low to the ground as possible to allow for boarding through built-in airstairs. It wasn’t built to carry 200 passengers across the Atlantic, but that’s exactly what Boeing did with the MAX.

It’s like putting a V8 in a Smart Car and then stretching it. You should probably just buy a different car.
If you don’t really care about aviation (first, thanks for reading this because I probably sent you the link), this derivative-mania still affects you. Trading technological advancement for safe profits does more harm than good. This article examines why aircraft design is risky, but also why it’s more dangerous to avoid taking risks.
