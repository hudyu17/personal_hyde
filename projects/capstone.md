## Overview
The Multidisciplinary Urban Capstone Project (MUCP) is a full year capstone course with projects sourced from cities, community groups, and NGOs. Students are final-year undergraduates from different departments, coming together in multidisciplinary teams to solve real urban problems under the mentorship of faculty members. 

We worked with HousingNowTO to produce a conceptual development plan for 3933 Keele Street. This plot of land is city owned and borders the upcoming Finch West LRT station, creating a prime opportunity to develop transit-oriented and affordable housing. 

**Our task was to propose an affordable, self-funded development to serve the Keele-Finch area for 99 years.** 

This took the form of 3 deliverables:
1. Basic master plan
2. Business plan (and funding details)
3. Designs and justifications

I took the lead on the 2nd deliverable (business plan). This was a new challenge for me; I was coming in with a background in computer science and statistics and had not previously done much financial modelling, especially not within this domain of affordable real estate. A quantitative and analytical background helped in this regard, and I continually sought out resources to bolster my understanding of the financial landscape behind this project.

## Defining the problem
Affordable housing in Toronto has grown increasingly limited, and low-income households are more prone to experiencing higher rates of housing affordability stress. The 3933 Keele Street West site in particular houses proportionally more lower-income families compared to the city average. For many of these families, their income prior to taxation was already below $30,000 (Smetanin et al., 2019, p. 35). 

Even with the high number of households on social housing waitlists, many of these units were left vacant due to the poor conditions (Côte and Tam, 2013). Additionally, social housing owners have little financial flexibility and are unable to increase rent; major repairs are therefore often deferred. Coupled with funding gaps, further price increases can be easily triggered alongside a reduction in the total number of available affordable units.

## Design process
We made it a point to review applicable literature, policy, and case studies to inform our initial proposal. We then engaged local organisations and subject matter experts to ensure we understood the context of our proposal and the priorities of key stakeholders. Key findings at this stage were that effective utilisation of the site will require improvements to the public realm, including daycare, community spaces, and retail uses. 

Following the preliminary research and site visit, three primary alternatives were possibilities the team explored:
1. A proposal that fits within the given portion of land available for redevelopment on the site (Site A). 
2. A proposal that cantilevers over the Finch West LRT station, of which will be occupying the northwest section of the property.
3. A proposal that expands into the lands currently occupied by the TD Bank in the adjacent property to the southwest of our site (Site B).

Further exploration was made regarding a cantilever, but it would only add ~10 units to the selected *Tall, Site B* option. We understand that this would have been an opportunity to potentially build something iconic and socially positive within the community, but the additional cost and complexity rendered this optional unfeasible.

## Project proposal
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/capstone/final-design-side.png">
<sub>*Renderings of our chosen alternative*</sub>

This tall design surpassed our goal of 190 units with a proposed 213 units — 107 of which would be affordable. This design maximised programmatic use to benefit future residents and the contextual urban fabric outlined in the Keele Finch Secondary Plan. The plan outlined a need for retail frontage and civic spaces that created a vibrant public realm. In response, our project imagines ground floor retail and commercial space concentrated at the Keele/Finch intersection together with tree planting and landscaping.

<sub>*Potential streetside usage of the Keele Finch intersection*</sub>

Based on the knowledge and interests of our team, it became a primary goal of our project to embody social, environmental, and economic sustainability. We propose contextualised programming, feasibility for 99 years of affordability during the lease period, and baseline considerations into architecture, landscape architecture, and management technologies to further strengthen a positive relationship with relevant quality of life and environmental factors.

## *Programming*
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/capstone/exploded.jpeg">
<sub>*Breakdown of proposed programming*</sub>

**Mechanical Penthouse:**
Beyond this project's scope, considerations like lower carbon fuel sources, heat recovery, and ground floor heating can potentially eliminate the need for a mechanical penthouse. This would leave this additional floor space free to be reallocated to more amenity space or additional residential units. 

**Outdoor Amenities:**
In addition to soft landscaping at the ground plane, we recommend the podium be used as both a green roof and semi-public outdoor communal space for the residents. A stepback of 2m around the tower will create a covered outdoor space that will act as the transition between indoor and outdoor amenities. A similar greening strategy should be implemented on the roof as well. 

**Retail/Commercial:**
The zoning for our site, outlined in the Keele Finch Secondary Plan, indicates the need for active ground-floor retail. In response to this, we recommend implementing various sized storefronts to accommodate a range of uses that could contribute to a vibrant retail sector along Keele Street. Due to the location of this site, we imagine this location would be most convenient for local residents as opposed to being a "destination" point. Therefore we strongly considered foot traffic on our site to suggest spaces that would best animate the space for most hours of the day. The building will provide 9 leasable spaces between the ground floor and first level along Keele Street. This may include things like coffee shops or active transit-related uses on the ground floor, with identified health-related amenities or grocery pick-up on the upper retail floor. 

**Daycare:**
As we mentioned earlier, a public daycare was expressed as a desire for this area, so it was integral that we could meet the minimum indoor (approximately 900 m<sup>2</sup>) and outdoor (approximately 300 m<sup>2</sup>) area requirements to qualify for the applicable funding. Of 665 sq m of green space on-site, at least 300 m<sup>2</sup> to the east of the building will be allocated to these facilities.  

## *Business plan*
I took the lead on creating the business plan, ensuring that the project could be funded sufficiently and financially self-sustaining for 99 years.  

This development will have similar economics to recent affordable developments in Toronto, chiefly regarding funding programs and emphasis on retail revenue. We are forecasting a best-case payback period of 7 years. 

At a high level, this scenario assumes full retail occupancy at market rates alongside favorable-rate loans and typical subsidies from federal and Open Door funding programs. This payback period will likely be longer due to a portion of retail being leased out at discounted rates for community purposes, or funding programs accounting for a smaller portion than the currently assumed 25% of construction costs. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/capstone/business.png">
<sub>*Breakdown of cash inflows and outflows for construction and operations*</sub>

Our 7-year forecast rests on construction deficits being approximately $31 million with annual revenues being approximately $4.6 million; this loosely produces a payback period of 7 years. 

| Hard Costs                                           |      $47,840,464 |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------:|
| Soft Costs                                           |      $16,159,510 |
| Total Project Costs (Hard Costs + Soft Costs)        |      $63,999,974 |
| Total Revenues / Contributions                       |      $33,150,000 |
| **Total Contributions Less Total Project Costs +/-** | **-$30,849,974** |

<sub>*Construction deficits of ~$31 million*</sub>

| Average 1 bedroom rental income per month |     $1,430     | Lower of AMR or 30% of income                             |
| Average 2 bedroom rental income per month |     $1,600     | 28% of families are single-parent (City of Toronto, 2018) |
| Subtotal per month                        |    $151,500    | Assume the 100 units are split evenly by unit type        |
| Retail rental income per month            |    $236,500    | 1,100 m² of retail (~1 floor)                             |
| **Total revenue per year**                | **$4,656,000** |                                                           |

<sub>*Annual operating revenues of ~$4.6 million*</sub>

The payback period will likely be longer than 7 years due to the assumed best-case scenarios not coming to fruition. Some retail units will likely be slated for community purposes and may therefore not command such rates, while residential rental revenues are subject to payment uncertainties. It could also take time for units to reach full occupancy, reducing revenues and adding to the payback duration.

## Learnings
Our team learnt an immense amount surrounding the complex domain of affordable housing, applications to the Toronto context, and how these topics relate to our specific disciplines. This section outlines some of the key learnings that we came to, both as a team and individually. 

## *As a Team*
**A new strategy is required to achieve Toronto’s affordable housing goals** 
- HousingTO’s goal of providing 40,000 units by 2030 is already ambitious, yet may even fall short of current needs - needs that will only increase in the future. 
- The difficulties surrounding integration with Metrolinx’s station box also highlight a potentially devastating lack of cooperation amongst key bodies responsible for transit and affordable housing. 
- For affordable housing to truly succeed, the city needs to act with greater speed and unity. 

**Real-world developments are heavily built around making tradeoffs** 
- This project was the first time many of our team members drove a real-world project and handled the resulting tradeoffs.   
- From the start, we had to balance a multitude of requests from different stakeholders. For example, there were relatively low-stakes decisions such as rationalizing setback reliefs, alongside key aspects such as creating a building form that addressed unit requirements in a sustainable manner. 
- Different parties pushed for their own - sometimes conflicting - interests, requiring our team to triage requests and create what we felt was the best outcome. 

## *My personal learnings*
**We have many ways to value and incentivise creation of affordable housing** 
- It’s far from perfect, but affordable developments have access to funding programs, lower interest rates, and developers can be incentivised to build good products 
- e.g. Daniels Corporation and Regent Park (pictured below)

**There’s a substantial amount of action going on that behind the scenes** 
- i.e. new affordable housing developments going up, projects in the pipeline 
- This development we’re working on will only begin the official design phase in 2024+

**The city/province needs a more unified method for urban development**
- This is especially true regarding cooperation between transit and housing developers
- The Metrolinx independent station box situation is an example of poor coordination resulting in an immense amount of additional - and often - impossible work, and critical TOD elements like station integration seem like an afterthought

## Conclusions
This project was an invaluable opportunity to contribute towards solving a true urban issue, allowing me to get deep into a problem area that is sure to become more relevant as Toronto's population continues to grow. 

The multidisciplinary aspect of the project also exposed me to new techniques and ways of thinking, especially surrounding the actual design of buildings. This included translating client and stakeholder wishes into physical requirements, then crafting them in a physical design - something that the architecture students in our group did expertly well. Although I did not explicitly contribute towards creating the physical components of the development, we undertook this process collaboratively and I could see how our thinking was progressively translated to the final design. 

Creating the business plan strengthened my ability to quickly learn the landscape of an unfamiliar area, both from a domain and skills perspective. Meetings with the housing secretariat and other City members were instrumental in confirming my independent research, showing me first-hand the value in engaging subject matter experts. I also took the opportunity to learn how to better lead these potentially ambiguous discovery sessions, a situation that I am sure will present itself in future professional settings.

Through it all, the hybrid environment of online/in-person programming was challenging to deal with. We started the year off in-person, having team meetings and site visits. The return to virtual work after the winter break created some disconnect - e.g. with timezones and personal health conditions - yet we regrouped and stuck to a disciplined, regular work schedule. I feel that our team's resilience showed the most in the final weeks of the project; we wrapped up exploratory interviews, delivered interim presentations to stakeholders, and completed our academic deliverables in quick succession. 

Special thanks to Petros Babasikas (our supervisor), Mark Richardson (with HousingNowTO), the MUCP team, and our own 3933 Keele student team. It was a pleasure to work with you, and we'll all look forward to seeing how the development turns out.
