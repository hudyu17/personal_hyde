cuHacking 2020 - Carleton University

<p>
 I had only done data challenges prior to cuHacking, so this was my first "real" hackathon. Our team built a React web app that used Google Cloud to perform sentiment analysis on tweets regarding RBC. We learnt a lot, and I also got to visit my friends at Carleton!
