Work by the Water 🏖️

This is a very simple site - my goal was to have something nice in the background when you study. For context, I actually found those 'study with me' / 'ambient studying' YouTube videos helpful during the pandemic, so I made this with a similar goal.

The site aggregates live videos of harbours and beaches, thrown in with some Jazz music and a map, because everyone loves maps (and I was trying to use react leaflet in something).
