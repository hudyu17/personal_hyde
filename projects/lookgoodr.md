lookgoodr, an obituary
</h1>
<hr>

This was the biggest project that I've undertaken in a while, and it honestly didn't turn out that great ðŸ¤¡ Consider this an obituary to the incredibly-named **lookgoodr**:

This platform sought to **connect those who were looking for fashion advice** (aka don't know how to dress, which may or may not include me) **with stylish people who love giving fashion advice.** 

The goal behind this was to fuel the <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/" target="_blank"> passion economy</a>.

I wanted to help people better monetise interests and skills that I believe are valuable, but haven't been traditionally seen as such. 

In this case, the value of having fashion sense. People pay for advice all the time - why shouldn't those with fashion sense be able to profit as well?

**Mistake 1: Fundamentally misunderstanding the problem**

Turns out that this isn't that big a problem, or at least the target market was very narrow. 

Those who care about dressing better would probably be actively searching for ways to do such, either through friends or the million reddit threads out there on the topic. 

Those who don't care about style - well, they wouldn't pay money for this anyway. 

**Mistake 2: Not understanding the buyer** 

We initially targeted students/fresh grads in tech who wore hoodies during their entire undergrad and now have money to spend on clothes. 

This decision was made (mostly by me) despite the fact that nobody from this demographic actually expressed a huge desire to dress better; it was always a: "sure, I'd *probably* want to" - but who doesn't?

There were definitely positives coming out of this. First off, it was fun ðŸ˜Ž

I also realised how exciting it is to work with passionate people.
