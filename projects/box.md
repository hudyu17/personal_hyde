betterbox ðŸ“¦, coming soon

<hr>

Still very much in the research / design / development stages, but here's the premise:

Subscription boxes are <a href="https://twitter.com/explodingtopics/status/1415332979610570752" target="_blank"> getting more popular</a>, probably because we've been at home for over a year. 

<del>The biggest</del> one problem with these services is the **waste** of throwing out a fairly sturdy cardboard box with **every monthly/quarterly delivery**.

We're therefore trying to make a reusable box, one that'll hopefully facilitate a truly circular process.
